A variety of Python scripts I wrote to interact with the Twitter API.  I intend to flesh these out with some statistical analytics a la Nate Silver.

(Note: I didn't upload the file that scrapes the Twitter feed as it contains my Twitter dev login credentials.
It's not difficult to create your own dev account at https://dev.twitter.com/apps and install Oauth2 Python library to access Twitter's feed.)
